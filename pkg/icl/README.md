# Inspur Community License (icl) Functionality
This tree is intended to house our non-Apache2 licensed Go packages. By
convention, all packages under this tree have the suffix `icl`.

Grouping ICL packages into one tree and clearly labeling all ICL packages
with a recognizable suffix will hopefully make it easier to identify and prevent
introducing any accidental dependencies on icl from Apache2 packages.
