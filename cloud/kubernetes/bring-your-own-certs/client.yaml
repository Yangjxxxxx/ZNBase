# This config file demonstrates how to connect to the ZNBaseDB StatefulSet
# defined in bring-your-own-certs-statefulset.yaml that uses certificates
# created outside of Kubernetes. See that file for why you may want to use it.
# You should be able to adapt the core ideas to deploy your own custom
# applications and connect them to the database similarly.
#
# The pod that this file defines will sleep in the cluster not using any
# resources. After creating the pod, you can use it to open up a SQL shell to
# the database by running:
#
# kubectl exec -it znbasedb-client-secure -- ./znbase sql --url="postgres://root@znbasedb-public:26257/?sslmode=verify-full&sslcert=/znbase-certs/client.root.crt&sslkey=/znbase-certs/client.root.key&sslrootcert=/znbase-certs/ca.crt"
